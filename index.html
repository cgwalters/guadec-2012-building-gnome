  <h1>Improving GNOME</h1>

<h3 id="why-are-we-here">Why are we here?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>GNOME is people and code</li>
  <li>People have different motivations</li>
  <li>Need <b>clearly defined mission</b> (Mozilla: "open web")</li>
  <li>Need <b>success metric</b> (#users? #commits? #applications? #forks? #features? #...?)</li>
</ul>
</article>
      
<article>
<h3 id="we-are-successful-enough">How about: We've already succeeded</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A lot of people use our software, for work and play.</li>
  <li>But we regress too often =(</li>
  <li>Thus primary goal is increasing success while avoiding regressions</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Disabling the second monitor makes things work, but with an obvious cost; one might describe it as a new form of the classic time/space tradeoff.</blockquote>

<h3 id="but-now-the-bar-is-black-regression-2">What's <i>not</i> a regression?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Intentional design changes that have been carefully thought
through, and where your computer still functions.</li>
  <li>Developers and designers in GNOME have to hold ultimate power;
we can't make the entire Internet happy.</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="feedback-cycle">Feedback cycle of "regular users" and GNOME</h3>
<ul>
  <li>People get GNOME from "distributions"</li>
  <li>If we're lucky, they sync their releases approximately to the
    GNOME cycle, and thus we only have a 1 month lag before they can upgrade</li>
  <li>"unstable" distributions - mix of unstable GNOME <b>and</b> unstable other things</li>
  <li>Live CDs - recent innovation, but unrealistic to expect people to download 600MB regularly</li>
</ul>

</article>

<article>
<h3 id="but-rpm-and-dpkg-screw-us">RPM and dpkg make avoiding regressions too hard</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Both define "upgrade" to be increase in version number</li>
  <li>Hacking around this (epoch, Debian <b>~really</b>) are too painful and ugly</li>
  <li>I believe this semantic deeply influcences our culture; kernel
      often reverts commits, rare to see discussed in "distributions"</li>
</ul>
