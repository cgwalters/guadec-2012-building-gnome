<h3 id="why-are-we-here">Why are we here?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>GNOME is people and code that approximately orbit nuclei such as
      GTK+, and Free Software.</li>
  <li>People have different motivations</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="what-should-we-do-here">What should we do here?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Need <b>clearly defined mission</b> (Mozilla: "open web")</li>
  <li>Need <b>success metric</b> (#users? #commits? #lines-of-code? #applications? #forks? #features? #...?)</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="history-of-gnome-plans">A brief, incomplete history of GNOME</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Don't rely on proprietary Qt toolkit</li>
  <li>GTK+2, GNOME 2, Sun involvement, a11y</li>
  <li>Ubuntu</li>

<h3 id="we-are-successful-enough">How about: We've already succeeded</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A lot of people use our software, for work and play.</li>
  <li>But we <i>regress</i> too often =(</li>
  <li>Thus primary goal is increasing success while avoiding regressions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="but-now-the-bar-is-black-regression">What's a regression?</h3>
<blockquote>Disabling the second monitor makes things work, but with an obvious cost; one might describe it as a new form of the classic time/space tradeoff.</blockquote>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/433409/">"The Grumpy Editor's GNOME 3 experience", lwn.net.  Jonathan Corbet, March 15, 2011</a>.

<article>
<h3 id="but-now-the-bar-is-black-regression-2">What's <i>not</i> a regression?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Intentional design changes that have been carefully thought
through, and where your computer still functions.</li>
  <li>Developers and designers in GNOME have to hold ultimate power;
we can't make the entire Internet happy.</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="feedback-cycle">Identifying regressions/feedback cycle</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Almost all testing during the development cycle is entirely
      manual, run on individual developer machines.</li>
  <li>Even if we had extensive automated integration tests, it's no
      substitute for actual humans attempting to use the code
      for <i>real</i> work.</li>
  <li>Almost everyone, except for developers who need to operate
      on the code, rely on binaries.  Which means in practice,
      we rely on "distributions".  And distributions here means
      <i>packages</i>.</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="flow-of-gnome">A regression is created by a commit</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Code doesn't break spontaneously; someone had to do it, and with
  revision control the change is associated with a <i>person</i>.</li>
  <li>git commit --[time]--> tarball --[time]--> package -> repository --[time]-->
     apt-get/zypper/yum -> filesystem -> reboot -> see it</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="rpm-and-dpkg-versioning">RPM and dpkg make reverting regressions too hard</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Both define "upgrade" to be increase in version number</li>
  <li>Hacking around this (RPM epoch, Debian <b>~really</b>) are too painful and ugly</li>
  <li>I believe this semantic deeply influcences our culture; kernel
      often reverts commits, rare to see discussed in "distributions"</li>
  <li>Oh also, if it breaks, you're screwed.</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="improving-jhbuild-since-last-year">Improvements in jhbuild since last year</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"sysdeps" extended</li>
  <li>Delete no longer shipped files</li>
  <li>War on -Werror</li>
  <li>git clean -d -f -x</li>
  <li>Default to parallel builds</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="jhbuild-why">Why are we still using jhbuild?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Focused on actual source code in git</li>
  <li>Parallel installs inside existing distribution</li>
  <li>Package system agnostic</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="ostree-for-development">OSTree for developers and testers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"git for operating system builds"</li>
  <li>Really just a new wrapper for <tt>make</tt>, <tt>tar</tt>, and <tt>wget</tt>, but:</li>
  <li>You can now parallel install operating systems quite efficiently</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="ostree-for-development-2">OSTree properties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Has essential property, like jhbuild and Live CDs, that it
      does <i>not disrupt your existing system</i>.</li>
  <li>Unlike jhbuild, delivers a complete system; you reboot into it.</li>
  <li>Unlike jhbuild, you download binaries from build server</li>
  <li>Unlike Live CD, you have your actual /home, and a writable filesystem.</li>
  <li>Unlike Live CD, easy to modify source code from system "as you see it",
      and reboot into your modified system</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="bisecting-regressions">Bisecting operating system builds</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A git commit causes a regression; OSTree tracks set of git
      repositories and revisions that go into each tree</li>
  <li>You can bisect across operating system builds; "my sound broke in the last week"</li>
  <li>I do actually expect users of Free Software to help participate
      in bisection.</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="removing-the-packaging-pressure">Not packaging</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Eliminates concept of packages (up to OS)</li>
  <li>Package is partial filesystem with <tt>%post</tt> shell scripts
      run as root attached</li>
  <li>OSTree manages (immutable) <b>named filesystem trees</b></li>
  <li>A <i>triggers</i> mechanism is centrally-maintained repository
      of <tt>%post</tt> equivalent
  <li>Ostbuild build system focused on source code in git
      repositories</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="architecture-details">Architecture</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Base system: Yocto (tarballs, cross compiler, stable)</li>
  <li>Bootstraps to: "ostbuild" (git, chroot, continuous integration</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="gnome-os-relation">"GNOME OS"</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A term tossed about; means different things to different people</li>
  <li>My <b>personal</b> motivation:</li>
  <li>Improve quality in FOSS (for everyone)</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="should-not-block-on-kde">Example: GNOME should not block on KDE</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For GNOME 3.0/Fedora 15, GNOME switched to NetworkManager 0.9,
      KDE depended on 0.8</li>
  <li>Could be called a Fedora problem, but then there is a notable
      section of Fedora users that only use GNOME, and Fedora is
      currently an important mechanism by which GNOME code is
      distributed</li>
  <li>Solution: Share source code, as much as possible.  Don't
      (necessarily) share binaries.</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="dont-package-meego">Example: Don't "package" MeeGO</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rather than wrapping MeeGO in whatever package format:</li>
  <li><tt>ostree-pull http://meego.org/repo meego-1.0-i686-runtime</tt></li>
</ul>
</article>


<article>
<h3 id="server-versus-client">Example: What should happen when you plug in an Ethernet cable?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In Fedora, NetworkManager (enabled by default, but not installed
      on servers until recently), used to automatically DHCP when an
      Ethernet cable was plugged</li>
  <li>Because of server concerns, NetworkManager changed to not do this</li>
  <li>But this breaks client.  Have no sane mechanism to distinguish between
      client and servers; both just sets of packages.</li>
  <li>Solution: Share source code, as much as possible.  Don't
      (necessarily) share binaries.</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h3 id="system-integration">The myth of the "DE"</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There's a bit more to it than picking some letters to prepend to
      DE and writing a GTK+ window that sets <tt>_NET_WM_STRUT</tt></li>
  <li>Networking</li>
  <li>How GDM allocates virtual terminals impacts everything</li>
  <li>What happens when you click suspend in the UI, then close the lid?</li>
</ul>

<article>
<h3 id="lets-do-it-anyways">Regardless, seeing latest GNOME is valuable</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Designers want to see what they're designing</li>
  <li>(A) version of GCC/X.org everything compiles with is defined</li>
  <li>Obvious place to host integration tests</li>
</ul>
